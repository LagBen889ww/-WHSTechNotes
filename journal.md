I cant say I like the new cell phone law or hate it.
The new cell phone law will help some of us with distractions, attention span and actually work. This benifits us and teachers but it also can make it harder on all of us because some students might not want to listen to the law. Students wont listen and some might start arguing, fighting, having an attitude and sleeping more in class. Teachers see this as a good thing but they only think inside the box (Not all teachers) assuming that the kids will listen to the law. The state probally thought that making it a law was gonna automatically make students get off their phones.
This futher proves that I dont hate or like it. I personally dont care if im not allowed on my phone because i wasn't on it a lot anyways my only problem is that we cant listen to music in class anymore.
